hello Ambre very good job with your Hackaton project. Very well use of a GUI in python. Only buttons wherent shure 
of how to use it are save as and open as. Also when marking a task like done you can add the (" âœ”") more than 
one time are you are not able to set the todo like not done again. Also be aware that when erasing some of the 
to do then there is empty spaces in where a todo was there before. Very good job doing a DRY code and adding
comments in to your project to make it more legible.



Congratulations on your project Well done
